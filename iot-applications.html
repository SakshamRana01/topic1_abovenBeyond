  <!--SUMMARY-->
  <h1 id="head">MORE ABOUT IOT :- </h1>

  <!--ACTIVITY1-->
  <h3 id="ac">ACTIVITY 1 :- (IoT Applications)</h3>
  <p>Activity 1 is all about the IOT applications , in which we discussed-> What is an IOT application , Different
    examples for IOT applications and the main features required in an IOT application.
    <br>
  <h4 id="subh">WHAT IS AN IOT APPLICATION ?</h4>
  <p>Connectivity of multiple sensors by analysing and further storing them in the clud database.</p>
  </p>

  <p>SOME EXAMPLES OF IOT APPLICATIONS :- </p>
  <nav class="navbar">
    <ul class="navbar list-unstyled">
      <li class="nav-item">Smart Watches</li>
      <li class="nav-item">Medical System</li>

  <!--ACTIVITY2-->
  <h3 id="ac">ACTIVITY 2 :- (Smart Buildings)</h3>
  <p>Activity 2 is all about the smart building , in which we discussed -> what does smart mean in technology
    <br>terminology , also understood the difference between a smart device and a simple device . We also focused on the
    main features need for the building to be smart , and also gone through some of the smart building scenarios .</p>
  <h4>WHAT ARE SMART BUILDINGS ?</h4>
  <p>Something that operates effectively and integrate into a communication network while concealing all complexity from
    the user to minimise human effort.</p>
  </p>

  <p>What are some Smart-building scenarios? </p>
  <nav class="navbar">
    <ul class="navbar list-unstyled">
      <li class="nav-item">Voice control operation in room.</li>
      <li class="nav-item">Retina recognition door locks.</li>
      <li class="nav-item">AI powered assistance.</li>
      <li class="nav-item">It employs preventative and predictive maintenance strategies and uses real-time field data
        to spot problems.</li>
    </ul>
  </nav>

  <!--ACTIVITY3-->
  <h3 id="ac">ACTIVITY 3 :- (IoT Intefaces)</h3>
  <p>Activity 3 is all about the control interface for our smart building , in which we went<br> through -> the
    High-level features for the smart building , and different parts needed to fulfil the desired and also mentioned the
    users who all it would be useful for .</p>
  <h4>WHAT ARE HIGH LEVEL FEATURES ? </h4>
  <nav class="navbar">
    <ul class="navbar list-unstyled">
      <li class="nav-item">Detection of an motion and sending data to control room giving indication that someone has
        arrived/leave</li>
